To setup Streamer vs Chat, you will need a Twitch account and your Twitch Chat OAuth Password
If you do not know your Twitch Chat OAuth Password, you can get one at https://twitchapps.com/tmi
Keep your Twitch Chat OAuth Password private and don't let anyone else see it. Treat it like it's another password for your account

Go into the scripts folder and open up setup.json
You will see a place to put your username and OAuth Password
Replace "username_goes_here" with your username, making sure to keep the quotation marks
Replace "oauth_key_goes_here" with your OAuth Password, making sure to keep the quotation marks. Do not omit the "oauth:" part of the password.

With that, you can now run RunWithChatListener.bat to start
This will open up both FNF and a command prompt
The command prompt should say "Connected to twitch.tv!" and not give any error after that
You should be good to go after that

If you get a "Failed to execute script main" error, then the setup.json file was formatted incorrectly
If you get a "socket.timeout: timed out" error, then the information you put in the setup.json file was incorrect

BTW, you can change the accepted_commands.txt file in the scripts folder if you want to disable any commands
