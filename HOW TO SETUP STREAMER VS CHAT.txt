INSTRUCTIONS FOR TWITCH
================================
To setup Streamer vs Chat, you will need a Twitch account and your Twitch Chat OAuth Password
If you do not know your Twitch Chat OAuth Password, you can get one at https://twitchapps.com/tmi
Keep your Twitch Chat OAuth Password private and don't let anyone else see it. Treat it like it's another password for your account

Go into the scripts folder and open up setup-twitch.json
You will see a place to put your username and OAuth Password
Replace "username_goes_here" with your username, making sure to keep the quotation marks
Replace "oauth_key_goes_here" with your OAuth Password, making sure to keep the quotation marks. Do not omit the "oauth:" part of the password.

Just run the game like normal after you've done all that.
The game will tell you upon start up if something went wrong.

BTW, you can change the accepted_commands.txt file in the scripts folder if you want to disable any commands
