Friday Night Funkin' FPS Plus is a mod of Friday Night Funkin' that aims to improve gameplay and add quality of life features.

*You can find the original game here:* **[Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) - [itch.io](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin) - [GitHub](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin)**

## Features

### Increased FPS
The orignal purpose of FPS Plus. The game has an increased framerate over the base game and even an option for a completely uncapped framerate.

### Better Input
Adjusts how the game handles input allowing you to hit notes more consistently.

This also changes held notes so that they disappear if released to early.

### Fully Rebindable Keys
So that you can use whatever wacky control scheme you come up with. Or you could just be boring and use DFJK. That works too...

### Improved Chart Editor
FPS Plus contains a modified chart editor that has more utility features and is way more user friendly.

### Improved Animation Debug
The animation debug has been adjusted to make editing offsets way easier and faster while requiring less guess work.

### Downscroll
Notes appear from the top of the screen instead of the bottom. This make help some people read patterns more easily.

### Improved Health Icons
Adjusted some of the health icons and adds winning icons.
